Project I am reviewing: Synthesizer
https://github.com/psydeolite/ap-final

Overall, the code seems to have made some progress in creating the layout of the piano and playing some notes. 
The most obvious errors I see are capitalization errors with "Key" in lines 122 and 127 and using the variable
"pitch" without initializing it at lines 123 and 128.
The code still needs to be documented and seeing how more function needs to be added to the piano, that should 
begin soon. Some of the variable naming (ex. public Key(int x, int y, int w, int h, int n); super(x,y,w,h); from
lines 114-115) make the code a bit difficult to follow from an outsider's perspective.
At the time I am coding this, there are the compiling errors I mentioned above which make it difficult to examine
what the current project looks like. However, based on yesterday, a some work still needs to be done depending on
how difficult it is to add the sounds of five instuments added into this project.
